    * Each node is either red or black.

    * root can always be changed from red to black, but not

    * 
    * All leaves (NIL) are black.

    * If a node is red, then both its children are black.

    * Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL 
    * nodes contains the same number of black nodes. 
    *

    * Some definitions: the number of black nodes from the root to a 
    * node is the node's black depth; the uniform number of black nodes 
    * in all paths from root to the leaves is called the black-height 
    * of the redâ€“black tree.[17]
